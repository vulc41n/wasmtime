;; wasm32 instruction selection and CLIF-to-MachInst lowering.

;; The main lowering constructor term: takes a clif `Inst` and returns the
;; register(s) within which the lowered instruction's result values live.
;; (decl partial lower (Inst) InstOutput)

;; Variant of the main lowering constructor term, which receives an
;; additional argument (a vector of branch targets to be used) for
;; implementing branches.
;; For two-branch instructions, the first target is `taken` and the second
;; `not_taken`, even if it is a Fallthrough instruction: because we reorder
;; blocks while we lower, the fallthrough in the new order is not (necessarily)
;; the same as the fallthrough in CLIF. So, we use the explicitly-provided
;; target.
;; (decl partial lower_branch (Inst MachLabelSlice) Unit)
